# Azure Functions using Python: HTTP Streaming & Open AI

The following sample leverages HTTP streaming with Azure Functions in Python. The function app retrieves data from Azure Open AI and streams the output.

Before running the sample, follow the instructions to [Get Started with Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python). 

To learn more about the HTTP streaming feature, [see Getting started with HTTP streaming](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-compute-blog/azure-functions-support-for-http-streams-in-python-is-now-in/ba-p/4146697). 

For any questions or feedback, please file an issue in the Azure Functions Python worker repository.
